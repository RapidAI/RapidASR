# RapidASR (base wenet)
- Our vision is to offer an out-of-box engineering implementation for ASR
- A cpp implementation of recognize-onnx.py in [Wenet-asr](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet) in which it implements the inference with ONNXRuntime.
- For a version of pure CPP code, we need to do a bit of work to rewrite some components.
- Special thanks to its original author SlyneD.
- Less is more. Less dependency, more usability.
- Just offline mode, not support stream mode, aka separate files can be recognized.
